Important: Digital Product Policy
NumGuru provides digital numerology reports that are generated and delivered instantly after payment. Due to the nature of digital products, we have a specific refund policy.
Our Refund Policy

You receive immediate lifetime access to your personalized report
The service has been completed as soon as the report is generated

When You MAY Receive a Refund
We will consider refunds only in the following exceptional cases:

Technical Error:

If we failed to generate your report due to a technical issue on our end
