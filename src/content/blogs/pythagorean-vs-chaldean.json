    "content": "<h3>Understanding the Systems</h3><p>Numerology is not a one-size-fits-all practice. Two of the most prominent systems used today are the <strong>Pythagorean</strong> system and the <strong>Chaldean</strong> system.</p><p>The Pythagorean system, which NumGuru uses, is often seen as more modern and highly structured, creating a perfect mathematical map of the name and birth date.</p><p>The Chaldean system, on the other hand, is ancient and focuses more on the mystical sounds of letters. While both are accurate, Western seekers usually find the Pythagorean logic easier to apply to personal growth and career success.</p>"
